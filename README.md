## Compression

VPL George R. Carder 2023

Library starting with LibCompression but now contains other utilities including:

- `LibCompression.sol` 
    -- compression option for data known to contain many zeros
- `LibDynamicBuffer.sol` 
    -- more performant than Solady's DynamicBufferLib for bytes arrays! 
    -- but less performant with primitive data types
- `LibEncryption.sol`
    -- xor streaming cipher!!!
- `LibPack.sol`
    -- efficiently pack/unpack arrays of various types


this repo started with the statment:

`compress the shit out of a bytes array. in this case "shit" is "zeros".`

not audited. use at your own risk.
